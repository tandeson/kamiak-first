= Summary =
 Goals:
  * Get a IDE (Integrated Development Enviorment) installed
  * Get a SVN client installed
  * Learn the basics of the IDE / SVN client.
  * Build a VERY simple program, look at the parts.

 Files:
  * example1.cpp

 Assumptions:
  * You are using a Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7 PC
  * You do not have a C++ IDE Installed
  * You do not have a SVN client installed.

  If any of these assumptions are wrong, e-mail me so I can work with you to provide instructions which will work for you!
